<a id="intro" class="anchor">Hi</a> there, letâ€™s start me start by introducing myself, my name is <a id="name" href="#">Jilbert Ebrahimi</a>. I was born on the 6th of December and raised in <a id="amsterdam" href="#">Amsterdam</a>, but my parents are both <a id="armenia" href="#">Armenian</a>. As I am one of three (yes, I am a triplet), there are two more versions of me walking this planet.
<br><br>
<a id="sell" class="anchor">Because</a> Container Solutions has lots of information on the website and social media, I feel as if I know the company quite a bit and I must say... I love it! Container Solutions gives me the impression that it really wants to invest in their employees. Working in a team and getting to know every aspect of front-end is an amazing opportunity I can't miss. The blogs are recent, relevant and give an insight into subjects that Container Solutions is concerned with. Also, Iâ€™m very interested in the Cloud Native adoption, this is because on my first and second (current) job I worked a lot on the cloud. My first job I sold private and public clouds (Azure) and helped clients to make the transition from on-premise to cloud adoption. This was always an interesting journey. On my current job, we develop websites and web applications mostly on the cloud (AWS) and help set up a new infrastructure for clients that want to make the transition. Seeing Container Solutions also focused on cloud transitions was another reason that spiked my curiosity.
<br><br>
I feel like I could evolve myself in an environment like Container Solutions and be a good addition to the team. My desire to learn to code combined with good and modern design has already taught me a lot. Everything I learned until now I did out of interest and love for the craft. After a whole day at the office sitting behind a monitor I still find joy in coming home, turning on another computer to work on side projects to be a better front-ender. I can only imagine the immense, positive impact it would have on me by being in a working environment that will guide me to be better! Being surrounded by people that also have the same interests and love the craft.
<br><br>
<a id="change" class="anchor">My</a> interest in code started from a young age when I used to make websites in a <a id="wordart" href="#">word</a> document. Now I know better and use Figma, XD, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. In my free time, I watch my <a id="serie" href="#">series</a>, play some <a id="fortnite" href="#">games</a> with friends, do freelance <a target=blank_ href="https://pics.jilbert.nl">photography</a> and create websites for silly little ideas I have. After all of that, I also like to solve all the <a target=blank_ href="https://fixed.jilbert.nl">problems</a> that people are experiencing with computers. I still really wanted to work with Adobe XD/Figma, I went to meetups and after that, I created reasons for myself to work with it. So, I created a couple of projects and took a UI/UX course.
<br><br>
<a id="outro" class="anchor">Well</a>, that's it! You now have some idea of the type of person I am. I would love to have a conversation and talk about further questions you may have. Also, Iâ€™m open to any kind of assessment to let you see what I have to offer. For now, good day and hope to talk to you soon!
