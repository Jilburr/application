  <a id="intro" class="anchor">Hi</a> there, letâ€™s start by introducing myself. My name is <a id="name" href="#">Jilbert Ebrahimi</a>. I was born on the 6th of December. Born and raised in <a id="amsterdam" href="#">Amsterdam</a> but my parents are
  both <a id="armenia" href="#">Armenian</a>. And as I am one of a triplet, there are two more versions of me walking this planet.

<br><br>

  <a id="sell" class="anchor">My</a> interest in Mirabeau started by knowing a colleague of yours and asking her about the company. Because of this and lots of information you have on the web, I feel as if I know quite a bit about Mirabeau and I must say... I love it!
  I have always had an interest in creating and developing things since the first time I got a computer. Before we got internet, I made websites in Word. Yes reallyâ€¦ Microsoft Word. <a id="wordart" href="#">WordArt</a> was a big part of my life back then. After we got internet I discovered
  Photoshop and made avatars and signatures for people to use in a forum. Designed websites in it and uploaded it as one big .bmp file whiles thinking is this how the big websites are doing it? After that, I got familiar with Wordpress and started
  editing existing templates to something I liked more and got some HTML, CSS and PHP knowledge. This was in high school. After I started my bachelor I started getting a lot more knowledge about everything surrounding websites and computers in general.
  After my first full-time job, I started doing online courses in my spare time because I wanted to glue all the bits of front-end knowledge together as I am certain this is the path I want to go.
  My future goal is to be a full-stack developer but for now, Iâ€™m focusing on being the best front-endâ€™er I can be before shifting my focus to something new.

<br><br>

  <a id="what" class="anchor">And</a> now on to the, what did I do with my life part. I studied for 4 years to get a bachelorâ€™s degree in something they called technical informatics with a focus on IT management.
  IT management was focused on creating a bridge between â€˜the businessâ€™ and IT. So, I learned a lot of different things from basic Java to C# and networks. After these 4 years, I started working at a business called Saasplaza.
  After quitting my first job I started doing a course for some type of Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool called the <a target=blank_ href="https://wem.io/">WEM modeller</a>. You can build websites (front and back end) in a very quick way. After that, I went and got my
  certificate for another RAD tool (<a target=blank_ href="https://www.outsystems.com/">OutSystems</a>) which can be used for creating a web application. This RAD tool is used at my current job.

<br><br>

  In my free time, after I watched my <a id="serie" href="#">series</a> and played some <a id="fortnite" href="#">Fortnite</a> with my friends, I love to do <a target=blank_ href="https://pics.jilbert.nl">photography</a>. Also, I like to create websites for every silly little idea I have. After all of that, I also like to <a target=blank_ href="https://fixed.jilbert.nl">solve problems</a> that
  people are experiencing with computers or any kind of technology. My love for design stayed close to me but changed mostly to photography. The company I work for now does not really care for UX/UI so any time I spend on that they see as wasted.
  I still really wanted to work with Adobe XD/Figma, I went to meetups and after that I created reasons for myself to work with it. So, I created a couple of projects in it and took a mini-course UI/UX.

<br><br>

  <a id="change" class="anchor">At</a> this moment you may wonder why I am looking for a different job. Outsystems is a RAD tool and RAD tools are all fun and fast if you work the way they want you to work with them. But if you step out of line all the positive aspects of such
  tool are gone. I love to code, I rather have that instead of a what you see is what you get kind of editor. Basically, I could go on and on about this subject. But this is the reason why I want to do actual front-end development.

<br><br>

  <a id="why" class="anchor">Mirabeau</a> gives me the impression that it really wants to invest in their employees. The mentorship program as stated in a front-end blog and giving people the opportunity to do what they love and are good at (design or develop heavy) is amazing
  in my eyes. The people who are involved with Mirabeau and the clients seem like a perfect fit for me. I feel like I can really evolve myself in that environment and be a good addition for the Mirabeau team. Also, I like to be part of a company
  that strives for new and innovating things like the Mirabeau framework and setting good (use case) examples.

<br><br>

  <a id="outro" class="anchor">Well</a>, that's it! If you are still here and reading thank you for that. Hopefully, you now have some idea of the type of person I am. I would love to have a conversation and talk about further questions you may have. Also, Iâ€™m open to any
  kind of assessment to let you see what I have to offer. For now, good day and hope to talk to you soon!
